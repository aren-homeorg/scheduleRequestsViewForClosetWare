This Project was created to switch from the past use of a Siteground MySQL hosted server to a Google Cloud SQL Instance migration. 

This specific query is to support the sync of new schedule requests on closetworld.com website with on-premises mssql servers, 
the eventual use case is to provide this data for an interface in ClosetWare (Closet World and Closets by Design coorporate CRM) where Call Center can further process these customer requests.

This database stores information and entries relating to website submissions and other critical information and data for website production and marketing analytics.
